# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias that exists towards reviewes that were written as part of the Vine program. By analysis the data I tried to answer the question: is having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. 

## Results

For this analysis I used a Pet Products dataset from the Amazon Review datasets and performed my analysis using Pandas. 

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
      
      There was a total of 37840 non-Vine reviews.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

      Number of Vine 5-star review: 65
      
      Number of non-Vine 5-star review: 20612

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

      Percentage of Vine 5-star review: 38.23%
      
      Percentage of non-Vine 5-star review: 54.47%

## Summary

Based on the performed analysis there is no bias and the non-Vine customers gave more 5-star reviews for products compared to the Vine customers. 

To have a clear understanding about the bias I would recommend running the similar analysis on other datasets. Especially it would be a good idea to use datasets with a higher Vine reviews number.
